# CreatureCompanion

 A little guy for your desktop

 Creature Companion is an idea I've had for a while, a little creature that hangs out on your desktop. Much like the "compainions" of old, but much less data-mining and invasive. 
The goal here is to create a Tamagotchi-like experience that isnt disruptive from day to day work. Purely a design choice for your desktop

# Current Features

These are the features that are currently implemented:

-Basic animations 

-Tobi-Kadachi Creature: The creature is currently a Tobi-Kadachi from Monster Hunter in a pixel art style!

-Wander state: The creature will pick a location on your taskbar and wander to it

-Sleep state: After 5 minutes, the creature will lay down, and sleep, for about 30 minutes

-Rest state: The creature will enter a resting animation

-Petting: If you click on the creature, a heart will spawn, and rise off screen

-Reloaction: Clicking and dragging on the creature will move them

-Throw: You can "throw" the creature with your mouse. I dont know why you would but, you can. Dont worry about them going off screen, they will wander back on

# Roadmap

Features I plan to implement in the future:

-Falling animation

-Picked-Up animation

-"In Between" animations: animations between states

-Feeding/Providing treats 

-Custom Creatures: Ideally I want to refactor the code so that implementing your own creatures and selecting them from a menu is quick, and easy
